## MyPlaces

Simple Map? to store and manage your favorite awesome places!!!

### Setup

- `npm start` to bootstrap the application into `localhost:5000`
- `npm build` to make the production build into the /build folder
- `npm test` to run the unit tests

### Libraries used

- `React` as the framework
- `MapBox GL JS` for the maps (pretty cool)
- `SocketIO` for socket communication
- `Material-ui v1` as the UI components framework (because I love it)
- `Heroku` for deployment

Coffee is a library? because I used it too! (not you coffeescript)

#### - Notes
- First time trying mapbox, it was pretty cool, the react wrapper helped A LOT specially the examples, they were pretty great
- Missed Redux a lot, but it was an extra complexity not needed for this App
- It took about 6 hours to make this app, actually, it wasn't hard, just little details there and there that I wanted to solve properly and that taked a lot of time actually :(
- Wanted to use Vue, but, that was a risk that I leaved for the backend hahahaha
